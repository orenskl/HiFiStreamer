# HiFiStreamer

HiFiStreamer is an attempt to setup and build a full Audiophile network streaming device software based Linux with a JeOS concept, the main objective for this project is pure audio **Bit Perfect** sound reproduction from the source to the sink (from the network to the DAC). The project currently uses [Mopidy](https://mopidy.com) as its audio network streamer and [Mopidy-Iris](https://github.com/jaedb/Iris) as the UI. The first implementation will support generic x86 devices and hopefully I will add ARM in the future. 

This project is based on the [LibreELEC](https://libreelec.tv) JeOS disribution.

**Contribution**
