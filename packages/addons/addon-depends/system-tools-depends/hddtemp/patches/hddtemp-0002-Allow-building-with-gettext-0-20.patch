    Allow building with gettext â‰¥ 0.20
    
    The use of AM_GNU_GETTEXT_VERSION in configure.ac instructs autopoint to
    copy po/Makefile.in.in from the exact gettext version. It is fine if the
    version of gettext installed on the system has the same minor version
    number with the requested version, but it fails if you have a newer
    version of gettext because of the mismatch between autoconf macros and
    Makefile.in.in.
    
      *** error: gettext infrastructure mismatch: using a Makefile.in.in
      from gettext version 0.19 but the autoconf macros are from gettext
      version 0.20
    
    Instead of specifying the exact version with AM_GNU_GETTEXT_VERSION, we
    can use AM_GNU_GETTEXT_REQUIRE_VERSION to ask autopoint to simply use
    the gettext version installed on the system to prevent the mismatch.
    
    This also bumps the version requirement on gettext to 0.19.6 because
    AM_GNU_GETTEXT_REQUIRE_VERSION was added in this version.
